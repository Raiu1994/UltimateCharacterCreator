# PersonalProject

This is the 2019 version of the Ultimate Character Creator which I first made in college. This version aims to 
improve upon the shallow framework first presented in the project.

This project will reach this objective in three ways.
* Creating a GUI which will present the options in this program in a pleasing manner.
* Creating a file system which will allow the user to export their created RPG character as a text file, which can 
either be a SAVE file for use in the program, or a basic Character Sheet.
* Using a module structure in order to bring the program under best practices.
